# Entropy and Mutual Information via Bin-Based Discretization

This repository contains some short, useful functions for the computation of the Shannon entropy of a random variable as well as the mutual information of pairs of random variables via bin-based discretizaton.

The script was written during the research process associated with my third research project at the Centre for Computation, Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology at University College London (UCL CoMPLEX). In this repository, you can find a detailed report describing my work which focussed on the investigation of causality in metabolomic networks.
