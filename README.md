# Application-of-Transfer-Entropy-to-Assess-Causality-in-Metabolomic-Networks

My third research project at the Centre for Computation, Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology at University College London (UCL CoMPLEX).

In this repository, you can find a detailed report describing my work as well as a relevant Python script "entropy_and_mutual_information.py" I wrote during the research process. The script contains some short, useful functions for the computation of the Shannon entropy of random variables as well as the mutual information of pairs of random variables via bin-based discretizaton.
